I'm a Porland-dwelling web developer in love with experimental tech, automated testing, and accessibility. I make super cool things at <a href="http://instrument.com">Instrument</a>. When I'm not ordering electrons around, I'm rock climbing, running, reading, and hiking. I still can't figure out how to win Civ 6 with a religious or military focus.
