I don‚Äôt like my blog.

To clarify: as of writing, I‚Äôm lukewarm on how article titles look. I don‚Äôt have per-post tags; I haven‚Äôt added pagination to the index. I could go on.

When I launched, about ten months ago, my list of complaints was even longer. I didn‚Äôt love my body font; I *really* didn‚Äôt love my `<ul>`s. I hadn‚Äôt written styles for section headers, tables, or asides.

But I had made something.

----------

This is actually the third iteration of my blog; the first two lived only on my local server, each `rm -r`'d when I realized that something about them wasn‚Äôt, and could never be, perfect.

As I laid the groundwork for my third version, I promised myself that *this*, no matter what, would be what I launched. I was done spinning my wheels on mechanical problems; I needed to move past that and start actually writing.

Because, naturally, my quest for perfection wasn‚Äôt just because I wanted to make a good-looking site. It was also a bid to avoid ever writing a single post. After all, if my site wasn't done, how could I publish things on it?

It‚Äôs so much easier to write CSS for myself than it is to write English for other people.

But here I am, ten months later, with a still-flawed *but productive* site, a site which lets me express myself, spread knowledge, and hone my writing skills. It's not perfect. But, perfections included, it's exactly right for me.

## Actual advice

**Most people I've talked to who self-host a blog get bogged down, as I did, in the creation step.** This is a reliable pattern because webdev is hard *and writing is even harder*. This is fine. You're fine. Make something good, make something that supports what you immediately need it to support, and get it out. the. door.

Here's a few things that helped me:

### Create content, then develop to that spec

You can't control what content clients create, so client work usually involves some kind of attempt [to anticipate every single possible action or state ever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem), which is a) super obnoxious and b) super fun.

How should we crop and position images if the client tries to upload something 800px by 80px? How should we space out the title if they only make it one word long? What if they create an article and then leave the body completely blank? Et cetera.

When you're your own client, you don't have to build what you don't need.

In my case, I had a couple of articles drafted so that I wouldn't deploy an empty blog (SO EMBARASSING RITE???). I used those, not Lorem Ipsum, as dummy content. I was able to build to my own exact needs, so I made a blog that worked perfectly *even though* I hadn't written styles for tables or even section headings.

My advice: don't make a bespoke Work of Art; make a system, but accept that that system doesn't need to be all-encompassing. Make a system that you intend to improve. Make the system *that you need*.

### Remember that you don't work in print

This is logically obvious, but was hard for me to get on board with emotionally.

If you think your site is ugly but you push ahead and publish posts a couple of posts, you can deploy better styles later and everything will now be pretty, *even the posts that were originally ugly*. Hooray for the internet!

<%= partial(:media, :locals => {
  :src => 'first-try.gif',
  :title => 'Animation from The Lego Movie: Batman throws Batarangs at a button until he hits it.',
  :size => 'secondary',
  :alt => '',
  :caption => 'And when you finally *do* get everything right...',
  :width => '358px',
  :height => '231px',
})%>

### Know that you're not famous

Or I assume you're not famous?

Anyway, a lot is made of splashy launches and Sticking The Landing, but whoever your idol is *is definitely not reading your blog right now*. You have time to improve it, time to find your voice, fix your wonky line-heights, etc. before it's read by Oprah or Dan Abramov or whoever. You have a lot of time to rehearse for that moment.

### Don't mistake labor for progress

Is your goal to make a good website, or is it to become a better writer?

I don't know how long it takes to get comfortable writing, to find your voice, to carve out a good schedule, to pick  topics that you reliably want to write about. But my blog has been live for ten months and I can tell you that I'm not there yet.

So let's say that it takes two or three years of low-intensity blogging before you develop proficiency.

That timer doesn't start until you're actually publishing posts. You can toil away for a year and a half on an amazing perfect üëåüèªüî•üíØ website; this will have zero effect on your writing prowess.

**Make something that advances you towards your goal**, or at least be honest about what you're working on and whether it's part of that specific journey. I've taken detours and they've been helpful and lovely but I'm not going to pretend that revamping my font-loading made me a better writer.

## Coda

Thanks for reading and for being with me on my journey. If you've been looking for a sign to start your own journey, let this be it. And I look forward to reading your work in 2018! üíÉüèª
