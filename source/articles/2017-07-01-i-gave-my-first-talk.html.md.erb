Last week, for the first time, I attended a conference not as an attendee but as a speaker. I loved speaking and plan on doing it a lot more in the years to come ðŸ˜˜

I want more people to speak, I want to demystify the process of prepping and giving talks, and I want to preserve these lessons for my own records. So here are some takeaways from my first foray into this strange land.

## As it happened

I gave a talk about [Building interactive art and installations using Socket.IO](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t2-ebDUL6r09tO1s18UXWvALtZg-cQebSZpEmikYUNE/edit?usp=sharing) at [We RISE 2017](https://werise.tech/) in Atlanta, GA. We RISE is a Women In Tech conference put together by [Women Who Code ATL](https://www.womenwhocode.com/atl). This year was its debut year and it **kicked ass**.

The conference focused on social progress in addition to tech itself, so while a bunch of the sessions were more "typical" tech conference fare, others were aimed at getting more women and people of color into and excelling in tech. Sessions were simultaneously running on using R for data science, committing to open source projects, and carving your own path towards leadership.

I had an amazing time at We RISE. It was my first time in Atlanta, my first time at a large majority-women tech event, and the first time I actually enjoyed a speaker panel. I learned about [cognitive complexity](https://www.sonarsource.com/docs/CognitiveComplexity.pdf), met some amazing folks, and am weirdly fired up to play around with Rust.
